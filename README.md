# World Layoffs Analysis Project
This project is a learning project from the [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst)  YouTube channel for the [Data Analyst Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UltKCnnnTA&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=20).

## Case Description
This project aims to analyze global layoff trends across various industries and countries using a dataset on company layoffs. The analysis focuses on understanding the distribution and impact of layoffs on different sectors and regions. Data cleaning and transformation were performed using SQL (MYsql), followed by data exploration and visualization using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/athari.k/vizzes).
